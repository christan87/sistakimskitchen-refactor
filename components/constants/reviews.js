        text: `Stopped in after being in the same plaza. Food was amazing, not a big wings guy. I gave it a shot and every wing was worth every bite. The atmosphere is nice, the ladies/owners are nice. They made sure that we enjoyed our food and had everything we needed. Definitely recommend stopping by and enjoy a good lunch. I got the sweet bbq wings, chicken sandwich, and fries. Worth every bite and dollar.`,
